# bose-av35-homeassistant
Home Assistant control of a Bose AV35 console using the Data port using an ESP32.
This is **not** good code, I got it to the point that it works and that was enough for me.
I doubt anyone else will ever use this.
I'm sure theres memory leaks, and many failure points, but it takes me less time to reboot it than to fix the code.
